# Welcome
Then end of another year has arrived. The end of another arbitrary period of time which humans have given a significant importance to. It sometimes feels silly. There is nothing different about the continuum that is time a second before midnight on NYE and midnight itself. But it's good.  It gives us the feeling of having a fresh beginning even though the reality is that nothing has changed.  
 
So here goes nothing. Here my ambition plants the start of a blog. Which, hopefully, nourished by a bit of passion and determination will flourish (or flounder) into something that will be equally useful to others as it will be to myself.   
 
To get things rolling and get out a first post, I'll make things easy for myself. A simple review of 2017 and rough itinerary for 2018.

## The good 
### 1. Academic Performance 
This year has provided the best academic results for a very long time. The reason is not entirely simple, my academic journey throughout the years is not a placid one. But some of the things which may have helped contribute to this small success: 
* Caringâ€¯less about learning and more about getting good marks 
	* Sounds brutal doesn't it? But in a way, even with the counter-intuitive attitude I do feel I ended up more learned by the end of the courses. Generally, if my marks weren't great it can be disheartening to see hard work unrewarded, leading to less motivation for the rest of the semester. Having consistently good marks meant my mojo was on through the 4-5 months. 
* Having motivated people around  
	* This was a big one for sure. In subjects where I had a motivated partner/group, I definitely lifted my game for that subject. These is a certain synergy and their habits of putting in strong efforts are certainly contagious.  
* Things didn't get out of hand. 
	* Wasn't behind course content for ~~any~~ most of the subjects
	* Most probably a by-products from above but I did make efforts not to fall behind content 
### 2. Use of time 
Perhaps for the first time I put a value on my time and tried to structure it. I had a to-do list which was kept updated and made daily schedules consistently. I made, but not always followed. But hey, it's a step forward. 

I also cut back on a lot of other things in my lifestyle and decided purely to focus on university. There was still *plenty* of underutilised time, but I **was** spending more time on my uni work. This was a doubled edged sword as I'll  write about later.  

### 3. Promises, sacrifice and the grind 
I made a few promises to myself throughout the year which I kept. I quit drinking coffee (I love my caffeine) for first quarter of the year, I had a total distraction ban on sites like youtube, facebook, reddit in the couple of months leading up to the exams. I tend to indulge in these sort of things big time and have failed in keeping such promises in the past, so it was a big deal for me to hold such abstinences. 

I've come to enjoy making difficult sacrifices. The grind has become rather addictive. Even though it can be painful, every time I resisted indulges I felt good about myself.  victorious abstinent act made me feel proud and by the end you come out the other respecting yourself more 

Another highlight would be completing some difficult of the projects for a uni society. I don't think I've ever felt so hopeless about the success of task as I did with this. This was a real grind. I remember spending countless hours trawling through technical reference manuals several thousands of pages long. Most of the time  for little or no reward. Somehow, little-by-little progress was made with the help of a big crunch at the end, the project was completed in time for the main event. It is nice knowing that I was able to complete what I genuinely thought was going to be impossible 7 months ago. FPGAs and their development technologies are a nightmare. 
 
 ### 4. Getting a job (or two) 
I got a couple of jobs as a software dev in the latter half of the which was a real confidence booster for my abilities.

## The bad 
### 1. Unbalanced lifestyle 
As mentioned earlier, I really tried to channel all my energies into one area: university. Although I was spending more and seeing results for it, the gung ho approach doesn't work for me in hindsight. Even though I would love to spend every living moment writing, reading and learning about computers, it just isn't me. Not yet at least.

I stopped exercising, sport, making time for friends and doing things which I would normally enjoy because I felt need to spend all my time on one area to specialise if I was to become really good at it.
This certainly isn't sustainable and didn't put me in a good headspace. 
### 2. Mindset 
The drive to be the best the world or an elite level had sort of dwindled last year. This ties into slight lack of motivation as well. Something to work on for the future, but I think having achievable goals for the year and beyond would help long term motivatation. We always strive harder when there is a target put in front of us.
